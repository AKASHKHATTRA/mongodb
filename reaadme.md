###A Citizen Information System 
(CIS) is a computer-based system that provides real-time information to citizens. It is designed to improve the dissemination of information among members of a community, particularly senior citizens. The system can provide updates on membership status, monetary assistance, and other relevant data.

##The development of a CIS involves the use of a suitable software development life cycle (SDLC) model. The Rapid Application Development (RAD) model is often used due to its flexibility and speed. The system architecture can be three-tier, which includes the presentation tier, application tier, and data tier.

The CIS is evaluated for its usability and performance. This can be done through surveys and interviews with user-respondents and IT experts. The results of the evaluation can guide improvements and adjustments to the system.

In terms of benefits, a CIS can help reduce barriers between seniors and society. It can also promote active aging by assisting older people to participate in society while preserving their independence and dignity. This can be achieved through the application of innovative ICT-based solutions.

#In conclusion, a CIS is a valuable tool for enhancing communication and information dissemination among citizens, particularly senior citizens. Its development and implementation should consider the needs and preferences of the end-users, and it should be evaluated for its usability and performance.
